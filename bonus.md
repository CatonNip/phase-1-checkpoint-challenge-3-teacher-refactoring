# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch is super useful in case we don't enter anything for an attribute we can set a default
answer to fill in the nil.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
The disadvantage of single inheritance is that you might get a class that fits into two other classes you have. To fix this you can have a class inherit from another class and then from the class you want. That way you get all of the benefits from the classes you previously inherited from by using super.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
Options is a good way of visualizing args and makes it much easier.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
Private is super useful if you don't want people to access your a certain part of your code.
 
5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
